## Availability

Communication is key, and being available is crucial.

- Even though my calendar can be full, I will make time, I'm just a message, or invite, away.

## Process and Development

We build things, products, services, data, let's do the right thing and adjust to meet our goals. Process should help, not get in the way, if you feel you're impeeded by our processes, let's have a conversation, if we agree things need to change, let's make it happen.

- Transparency, that's they main key to success.
- I value growth and learning, fail fast, and learn, experiment with clear goals and feedback loops, and help others by sharing your experience.

- Stability, consistency and predictability, we should have always remember this.

- Empathy, having it will help us build great teams.

## Transparency

I will strive to keep you informed about the team's, department's, and company's activities. Feel free to ask me anything; I will answer to the best of my abilities. Occasionally, I might not be able to, but I promise to always be honest with you.

## 1:1 Meetings

One-on-ones are time for you, you're the driver of these meetings, it's an open agenda and they're not only about work. We can talk about things like:

- What's on your mind?
- What's exciting you?
- What's frustrating or concerning you?
- What can I do today to make you happier or more productive?

We don't need to cover project status unless you want to. I'll ask questions and provide feedback, you can also provide feedback, but this is your time.

The length, frequency, and medium of these meetings are flexible.

## Feedback

Candid and compassionate feedback is crucial for a cohesive, high-functioning team. I value direct feedback and am committed to providing you with clear and timely input. I hope youâ€™ll do the same for me.

For effective feedback, consider the following:

- Safety: Feedback should be given without fear of punishment.
- Effort: Providing feedback should be easy, with minimal arguments.
- Benefit: Feedback should significantly impact behavior.

Let me know if I fall short in any of these areas.

## Work/Life Balance

I highly value work/life balance for both myself and you, as long as we accomplishming our goals and hitting our targets, all is well. I do not expect communication outside of regular hours. I refrain from responding to emails or direct messages during off-hours and do not expect you to do so either, except in emergencies.
